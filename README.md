## Installation and Setup

1. Install dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`

2. To start the dev server, `run npx expo start`

3. If you have the Expo Go app, you can scan the QR code to open the app on your device

4. If not, you can use the device simulator on your local machine (must have Android or iOS simulator)

5. If the app fails to load with an error saying that the app is taking longer than usual, rerun the command with the --tunnel flag: `npx expo start --tunnel`
