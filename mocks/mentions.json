// Mention is within a specific community and channel, always has message content
// Friend request is not within a community or channel, does not have message content (could in future have content if we allow users to send a message with their friend request)
// Invite can be to a community in general or a specific channel within a community that a user has already joined
// Direct message: If Slack-like, DMs are within a community. If not, DMs are outside of the community. For this, I will assume DMs are outside of the community and can be between any users. Direct messages have IDs, but no name
